Today I tested [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/), a fast-growing Swedish startup that promises to be a "superhuman full-stack developer." The idea is that you describe your desired app in natural language, and its AI builds it for you.

### Experience with Mind Maps

I experimented by asking Lovable to "vibe code" a mind-mapping application. The tool succeeded in generating a basic mind map interface that runs entirely in the browser. However, when it came to building a backend for storing these mind maps for future expansion and for other users, things became more complicated. The system wanted me to work with Supabase, an open source backend platform.

### Backend Complexity

While the "superhuman developer" aspect was appealing, it turned out that Lovable only partially aids the process. The promise of a no-code solution quickly fades when you realize that a study of technical documentation may be necessary to bridge the gap.

### Security Concerns

Adding to the complexity, a person claiming to work for Palantir recently mentioned on X (formerly Twitter) that he discovered several [security issues in production apps](https://x.com/danialasaria/status/1911862269996118272)created by vibe coders using Lovable. Upon reviewing the code the AI generated for me, I noted multiple "moderate" vulnerabilities (think cross-site scripting, XSS). This underscores that we are not yet at a stage where one can rely entirely on an AI to produce secure, production-ready software.

More about security, debugging and ai-agents can be found at [Gary Marcus' blog](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/those-claiming-were-mere-months-away). 

### Conclusion

Lovable is an intriguing platform for rapid prototyping, but be cautious: always have a professional review any code you plan to deploy in a production environment. The dream of a fully autonomous, error-free AI developer remains distantâ€”we are far from the era of AGI, let alone superintelligence.
