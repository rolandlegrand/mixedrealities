title: "Obsidian and Jekyll: A Minimalist Blogging Setup"
date: 2025-04-10
---

I've set up this blog using a combination of Obsidian for writing and Jekyll for publishing. Both tools work with Markdown, making it easy to create content without unnecessary complexity.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses simple symbols to format text. For example, you can use asterisks for *italic* or **bold** text, hashtags for headers, and dashes for lists.

## Why This Setup?

- **Local-first**: Obsidian lets me write and organize notes locally
- **Simple**: Jekyll converts these plain text files to a static website
- **Privacy-focused**: No databases, no tracking
- **Open source**: Jekyll is fully open source (MIT license)
- **Free hosting**: GitHub Pages hosts the site at no cost

I'll be using this space to explore mixed realities, sharing thoughts on VR, AR, AI, and the intersection of digital and physical worlds.

## Privacy Note

This blog relies solely on static Markdown files and doesn't collect any personal data. However, since it's hosted on GitHub Pages, GitHub may collect certain information (like IP addresses) from visitors in accordance with their [privacy policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).
